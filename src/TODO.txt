- Allow for decorators to seal the output (to prevent various output decorators trumping each other)
- HTML Expressions
- Standard JQuery plugin expressions??? (jqGrid, jqModal, etc?)
- Decorators:
    - Authorization
    - Output caching (output model)
    - Output caching (rendered HTML/JSON output)
    - RSS
    - ATOM
    - XML
- Once the infrastructure calms down a bit (maybe when the config DSL is done?), do some rough docs
- BoundExpression with prefixes
- MaxLength, required, etc flowing from the domain
- Have the config DSL manipulate the routing as well (to achieve 'areas' support as well as centralize URL generation)
